#####  Project Preview #####
Creating a simple portfolio/resume page for a nature photographer. I am using a template for the basic design of the page though it will all be coded by me. 

#####  Guidelines #####

I will be using Flexbox for the layout though I will not be using SASS for the css portion of it. I will be going a bit easy on this project, though I will be trying to use Git in a more defined role by creating each new element in its own branch and then merging them together once completed.
